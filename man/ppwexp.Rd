\title{Distribution function for piecewise exponential regression}
\usage{
ppwexp(t, theta, J, tcut, q = 0, x = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{The vector of time points.}

\item{theta}{The parameter vector consisting of gamma for log
piecewise hazards and beta for regression coefficients.}

\item{J}{The number of time intervals.}

\item{tcut}{A vector that specifies the time intervals
for the piecewise exponential survival distribution.
Must start with 0, e.g., c(0, 60) breaks the time axis into 2 event
intervals: [0, 60) and [60, Inf). By default, it is set to 0.}

\item{q}{The number of elements in the vector of covariates
(excluding the intercept).}

\item{x}{The vector of covariates (including the intercept).}

\item{lower.tail}{logical; if TRUE (default), probabilities are
the distribution function, otherwise, the survival function.}

\item{log.p}{logical; if TRUE, probabilities p are given as log(p).}
}
\value{
The probabilities p = P(T <= t | X = x).
}
\description{
Obtains the distribution function value for piecewise
exponential regression.
